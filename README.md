# Sample_Map (600.315/415 Final Project)

## Jay Miller (600.415), Trevor Aron (600.315)

For this project, we created a database that holds info on artists, songs. The primary relation in this database is one called 'sampled' which maps a primary song, to other songs which are sampled (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)) by the primary song. Other info on artists and songs that are stored in the database are artist location, years active, and metrics on the song such as estimated tempo, and a 'danceability' scale. The main report produced is a map which when given an artist, will show that artist on the map as well as show the locations of all the artists that that artist sampled (or vice versa).
